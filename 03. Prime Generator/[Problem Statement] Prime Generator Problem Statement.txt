		Prime Generator

Question:
	
	You will be give one integer N indicating the number of testcases.
	This will be followed by N lines of input, each line containing two number A and B.
	It is guranteed that for every line, A < B.
	
	For every line of input, you are to print all the numbers that lie in between A and B and are prime (including A and B, if applicable).
	The output should contain one prime number on each line. The answers for two different test cases should be separated by an empty line!


Example:-
	INPUT:
		2
		1 10
		3 5

	OUTPUT:
		2
		3
		5
		7

		3
		5
		
		
	EXPLANATION:
		The prime numbers lying between '1' and '10' are {'2', '3', '5', '7'}
		Then, an empty line is printed indicating the end of first case and the beginning of the next one.
		Similarly, the prime numbers lying between '3' and '5' are {'3', '5'}
