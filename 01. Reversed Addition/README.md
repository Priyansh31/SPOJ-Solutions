		Reversed Addition

Question:

	You will be give a number N indicating the number of testcases to be followed.
	In the following N lines, you will have two numbers on each line. You have to calculate the sum of the two number on reversing. 

	For each line of input, you are to print one line of output that is produced on adding the reverse of the two numbers. 
	The answer is to be devoid of all leading zeroes.
		Leading Zeroes → The zeroes that are placed before any number. The initial "000" are the traling zeroes in "00012300"!

		
Example:
	INPUT:
		2
		24	1
		305	794
		
	OUTPUT:
		34
		1

		
	EXPLANATION:
		The first line contains two numbers '24' and '1'. The reverse of these numbers is '42' and '1'. On adding these two numbers, 
		we get, '43'... The reverse of this number is '34'. Since the output is devoid of leading zeroes, we print the answer as '34'.
		
		The next line contains two numbers '305' and '794'. The reverse of these numbers is '503' and '497'. On adding these two numbers, 
		we get, '1000'... The reverse of this number is '0001'. Since the output is devoid of trailing zeroes, we print the answer as '34'.
